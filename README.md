# bug-tracker
 Bug tracker web app built using the MERN stack with added authentication using JWT

# Get started
To start, create a .env file under /api with variables SECRET_KEY and URI:
- SECRET_KEY: The secret key used for JWT signing
- URI: The URI of the Mongo database

Next, edit `setupEnvironment.bat` and change the file paths so they are accurate for your situation.
Then run the .bat file to start both the client and the API.
